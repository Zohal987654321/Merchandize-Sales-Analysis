# Business Analysis for Lee Chatman's Merchandise Business

## Overview

Working as a business analyst and helping key stakeholders understand their data to create improved decision-making and insight starts by understanding user stories and pain points and then rolling up your sleeves to help businesses obtain clear, actionable insights from data. This ultimately enables progress by making decisions that hit the right spot for the business and enhance its growth and success.

This is precisely what I did in my capacity as a business analyst for Lee Chatman's merchandise business (a fictitious business with data from the Onyx Data January Challenge to showcase my take on such business problems and solutions).

## Summary

In 2023, Lee launched his own line of merchandise. This analysis looks at how his merchandise sales are going and what we can learn from the data. The business has achieved a total revenue of **$856,462**, selling **12,334** products (Nov 2023 - Nov 2024). Despite slight monthly sales fluctuations, we saw significant dips in June and August, which need further investigation. üåê

## Features Used
